# Phase 1

## An NFT as a Login Credential Protocol

### Allow me to explain the project via a story:

Alice goes to Phewdemy to learn blockchain development. SheÂ buys the Blockchain Dev Course as a NFT and pays in eth.

Each time Alice goes to Phewdemy, the platform calls a function on the blockchain to check if:

1. Alice has the NFT to log into this particular course?

2. Is the subscription still valid or expired?

3. If both the answers are yes, Alice gets access to the course.

Alice is done with the course but has some validity left. She sells the NFT in a secondary marketplace and saves some bucks.

Bob, who bought the subscription NFT from Alice at a cheap rate and with less validity, can check the course out before committing to buy a fresh one.

### Phewdemy can

1. Upload an infinite number of new courses, each with a unique NFT.

2. Each course can have an infinite number of subscribers.

3. It can charge a royalty when Alice sells the subscription in the secondary market.

4. It can do all of this and more just by following steps:

   - Install our NPM package in the back-end
   - Add their wallet details securely in the back-end

> The protocol will be able to support an infinite number of Phewdemy like subscription providers for free without them needing to be experts in Smart Contracts, NFTs or Web3. All they need to have is a crypto address(which we can provide if they don't have yet).

# Phase 2

> A marketplace where subscription NFTs of the above kind can be bought, sold, and rented.

### Basically an Opensea for the Subscription NFTs.
