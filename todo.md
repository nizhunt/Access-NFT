# Todo

- add an after-mint/before-mint hook that sends the mint details to external contract
- switch to newer form of errors ie. revert()
- implement renting logic
- switch from allowAll to allow(token) in both transfer and rent
- Implement batchMint logic
- implement upgradeability and figure out how it works with subgraphs

## after deploying the contract, mint the 0th nft yourself, set the protocol wide baseUri
